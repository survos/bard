<p>Worthy but limited 'Macbeth'<br>

  The most clever moment in Folger Theatre's &quot;Macbeth&quot; is in the first 
  scene, when the witches gather. Instead of casting spells, they are counting 
  ballots by holding them up to the light, just as in the Florida recounts last 
  year.<br>
  Director Joe Banno chose to set &quot;the Scottish play&quot; (as superstitious 
  theater folks call it) in circa 1960 Louisiana, an apt decision. When referring 
  to Louisiana's government, writers invariably have called it &quot;colorful,&quot; 
  a euphemism for &quot;corrupt, but in a charming way.&quot;<br>
  King Duncan (Tom Quinn) thus becomes an elected politician, perhaps the governor 
  &#8212; it's difficult to tell, because the names and titles are unchanged from 
  the original text. (Perhaps &quot;King Duncan&quot; also is an oblique reference 
  to Louisiana Gov. Huey &quot;Kingfish&quot; Long, who served briefly in the 
  U.S. Senate and was assassinated in 1935.) Macbeth (Michael Tolaydo) is Duncan's 
  lieutenant, and is disappointed when Duncan names his son as heir.<br>
  Since Mr. Banno conceived this staging, however, two events have undercut his 
  vision. First, two independent studies did not determine that President Bush 
  lost the election. The other was the terrorist attack last month. Suddenly, 
  a bloodless, lawyer-dominated struggle over the presidency doesn't seem so terribly 
  important.<br>
  The cast Mr. Banno assembled is as solid as one might expect from the Folger. 
  Although the lesser parts are not as well-drawn as in Shakespeare's other great 
  tragedies, the supporting characters are represented ably here. Michael Russotto 
  plays Banquo as a slightly naive Episcopal minister. Andrew Ross Wynn shows 
  his dramatic range as a nobleman, a murderer and an earthy Cajun cook.<br>
  Two of the biggest standouts are Scot McKenzie, as Duncan's heir, Malcolm, and 
  John Lescault as Macduff. With his creepy, blue-eyed intensity, Mr. McKenzie 
  is unnervingly good as the young sybarite who inherits Scotland through untimely 
  death. Mr. Lescault comes into his own near the end of the play, when he receives 
  the news that his family was brutally murdered, and he takes up arms against 
  Macbeth.<br>
  Lucy Newman-Williams' Lady Macbeth is not stellar, but quite solid. Her part 
  is the most difficult in the play &#8212; modern audiences are always prepared 
  to laugh at bathos if they detect it, and raving madness and suicidal guilt 
  are prime occasions for bathos. She solicits evil deeds in her harmless-looking 
  pink clothes and masks her thoughts until they burst out and overwhelm her psyche. 
  Her final end is astonishing if not pitiable.<br>
  Which brings us to Macbeth himself. When he is translated from 11th-century 
  Scotland to 20th-century America, he must become a democrat. Mr. Tolaydo's Macbeth 
  is every inch a democrat, right down to how he puts his hands in his pockets 
  while delivering a soliloquy. He is not noble in body or spirit, nor does he 
  aspire to be; he merely wishes to exercise power over others.<br>
  His performance is true to the choice of settings, but it shows that the setting 
  has lowered the stakes of the play. In the text, Macbeth is introduced as he 
  returns from war. In this production, he hasn't been slaughtering other human 
  beings, but gathering votes for his boss. In a medieval monarchy, slaying the 
  king meant slaying the government and destroying an image of God's reign in 
  heaven. To kill a legislator, even a governor, in the American context is a 
  crime against society but not nearly as subversive or meaningful.<br>
  Mr. Tolaydo is in fine form as he descends into despair and nihilism, his body 
  drained of emotion. His mannerisms, such as when he fingers his wife's beaded 
  necklace like a rosary, are particularly inspired.<br>
  Mr. Banno's interpretation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; is commendable in many ways 
  and undeniably well-executed. It is irretrievably limited, though, by its circumstances. 
  Even the dullest spectator must admit that concluding a play with a good sword 
  fight is more grand than a &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;-style shootout.<br>
