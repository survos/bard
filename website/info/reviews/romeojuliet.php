  It's tough to be star-crossed lovers these days. Everyone knows your story: 
  impetuous young people who defy their parents, only to die unnecessary deaths. 
  Delivering lines such as, &quot;Wherefore art thou, Romeo?&quot; is no fun, 
  either: The audience has heard them a thousand times before, both in the play 
  and in cultural detritus such as advertisements and third-rate comedy sketches.<br>
  Many die-hard Shakespeare fans probably groan inwardly at the mention of &quot;Romeo 
  and Juliet,&quot; which is a popular favorite but hardly of the same rank as 
  &quot;King Lear&quot; or &quot;Hamlet.&quot; The Shakespeare Theatre's attempt 
  at the play might just intrigue the most jaded theatergoer. It's as fresh and 
  unmannered as youth itself &#8212; although the passion doesn't erupt as violently 
  as it should.<br>
  Young British director Rachel Kavanaugh commendably doesn't show Mercutio and 
  Romeo as closet homosexuals, or set the play in the 18th-century Australian 
  outback. The Shakespeare Theatre's recent production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; also 
  was played in medieval Denmark, just like it says in the play. Perhaps there 
  is a new trend around Washington of doing Shakespeare straight. If so, let's 
  encourage it.<br>
  Jennifer Ikeda looks perfect as Juliet and easily passes for a girl not yet 
  14. She does best with anger and exuberance and not so well with sorrow or melancholy. 
  <br>
  Paul Whitthorne makes a decent Romeo, but to be fair, Romeo is not the greatest 
  male part. Some scholars think his speeches are parodies of 16th-century romantic 
  poetry, and that is amply supported by the text itself. Romeo's instant love 
  for a girl across a room is so sudden that you wonder about his sanity.<br>
  Mr. Whitthorne and Miss Ikeda are best when they are together, and their handling 
  of the two most famous scenes &#8212; their first conversation and kiss in the 
  Capulet house and the balcony scene &#8212; are marvelous. The actors show their 
  characters to be completely sincere in their mutual infatuation. Romeo truly 
  believes Juliet is a holy creature who compels his adoration, and Juliet believes 
  she was put on Earth to join herself to Romeo.<br>
  The lovers are supposed to be the eye of a hurricane of resentment, pride and 
  violence that swirls around them and eventually flings them to their demise. 
  The length of the script is punctuated by references to death, which become 
  more and more frequent as the bloody climax approaches. However, the opening 
  fight scene isn't vicious enough to provide the sense of menace that the rest 
  of the play requires. The later fight, in which Mercutio (Harry Carnahan) and 
  Tybalt (Andrew Long) die, does have the bitter taste of malice to it and gives 
  the second act a needed dramatic boost.<br>
  The supporting performers distinguish the play. In the lobby during the intermission, 
  I heard many people murmuring that the Nurse (Claudia Robinson) was the best 
  thing about the play, and I wouldn't disagree with that. Friar Laurence is played 
  by Joseph Marcell, a British actor best known as Geoffrey the butler in television's 
  &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.&quot; He is one of those rare actors who 
  makes each line compelling, and his presence onstage is an assurance that the 
  scene will go well.<br>
  Edward Gero teases out latent aspects of Lord Capulet that may come as a surprise 
  to those who think that the main theme of &quot;R&amp;J&quot; is adult foolishness. 
  He has a hidden streak of liberality and tolerates Romeo's presence at his party 
  because he has nothing against the boy, despite his hatred of the Montague family. 
  He is irascible at Juliet's disobedience, yet a caring father who goes to pieces 
  at her death.<br>
  Technically, this &quot;R&amp;J&quot; is exemplary. The minimal, inspired set 
  by Peter McKintosh consists of balconies and catwalks supported by a number 
  of wooden columns. We can still see entire bodies through the balcony rails, 
  and the verticality makes the stage seem even bigger than it is. Hot white light 
  envelops Juliet when her emotions are aroused, and the other straightforward 
  but subtle lighting effects by Howell Binkley are welcome enhancements to the 
  action.<br>
  Fabio Toblini's costumes are drawn from a variety of periods, and they mostly 
  hang together, although the mix of Mercutio's jeans with Lady Capulet's high 
  collars is a little too much. Real Franciscan friars have worn brown robes with 
  ropes tied around their waists for 750 years; why give them blue robes with 
  oversize, 1980s-style brown belts? The designers do right by Juliet, though 
  &#8212; her floor-length dresses and slips underscore her virginal purity and 
  youth.<br>
  &quot;I believe in text-led Shakespeare,&quot; Ms. Kavanaugh says in the program 
  notes. &quot;What one has to do is absolutely go back to the words on the page 
  and then try to reveal that rather than impose any concept.&quot; Put another 
  way, the plot simply unfolds, and the actors merely act. Although this production 
  isn't perfect, it has a beautiful, endearing simplicity that can only be attributed 
  to Ms. Kavanaugh living out her credo.<br>
