<p>Silent 'Hamlet' like none other<br>

  Shakespeare purists who insist that cutting any dialogue from a work of the 
  Bard is like taking a pair of scissors to the Bible ought to avoid the Synetic 
  Theater's production of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; In this production, every word has 
  been omitted. <br>
  &quot;Hamlet&quot; is the most quoted and studied play in the English language, 
  maybe even in any language. Everyone knows at least a few lines from it, even 
  those who don't know they do.<br>
  The opening sequence of this production, when the actors look and dance like 
  Mike Myers' Dieter in &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; provokes an uneasy feeling 
  that a silent &quot;Hamlet&quot; isn't the wisest choice. A skull, the emblem 
  of Act V, Scene 1, makes an early appearance when Prince Hamlet (Paata Tsikurishvili) 
  then blows on the skull like a trumpet. <br>
  After the off-putting introduction, the play gets on its feet, running for the 
  bloody conclusion. At a lithe 80 minutes, this &quot;Hamlet&quot; doesn't get 
  a chance to be sprawling or ponderous, and that is good for everybody. <br>
  This &quot;Hamlet&quot; is difficult to characterize, which is precisely the 
  point. It contains a lot of stylized movement and dance, but the play isn't 
  &quot;re-imagined&quot; as a long interpretive dance number. Nor is it simply 
  the play with the words subtracted, as in a pantomime. It is the first production 
  of the Synetic Theater, a new project begun under the aegis of the Stanislavsky 
  Theater by Stanislavsky co-artistic director Tsikurishvili and his wife, choreographer 
  and pantomimist Irina Tsikurishvili. <br>
  If you want to see the play, it helps immensely if you know the plot ahead of 
  time. A couple of scenes do work better with words &#8212; the business with 
  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is hard to discern until they're dead, at which 
  time they are more recognizable. <br>
  Mr. Tsikurishvili, who also directs, cooperates with the script rather than 
  using it as a springboard for his own theatrical indulgences. That is not to 
  say he follows the plot with Jesuitical precision (one of the scenes, a flashback 
  to the death of Hamlet's father, is a fabrication), but he shows respect for 
  the play's integrity. As the title character, Mr. Tsikurishvili is better at 
  expressing himself through his body than his head. Even through emotionally 
  wrenching scenes, he almost appears to be a very limber puppet, with his torso 
  and limbs exploding with energy and his face as immobile as a woodcarving. <br>
  Catherine Gasta, as Queen Gertrude, is suitably repulsive as Hamlet's conspiring 
  mother. As the Player Queen and the Courtier, Irina Koval distinguishes herself 
  from the other actors, in one instance performing a comic striptease without 
  removing any of her clothes. Miss Tsikurishvili makes an ethereal Ophelia, who 
  seems to die gradually as the play progresses. Her death culminates in an ecstatic 
  embrace of death's final release. <br>
  The black costumes and the black set, both designed by Georgi Alexi-Meskhishvili, 
  contribute to the sense of doom and darkness. Lighting effects by Colin K. Bills 
  greatly accentuate that mood. <br>
  The music, which is taken from works by Georgian composer Giya Kancheli, dominates 
  the play almost as much as do the actors themselves. Funky bass-driven numbers 
  are interspersed with classically inspired compositions to a weirdly compelling 
  effect. <br>
  The visual tropes woven through the play are by turns amusing and disturbing. 
  Hamlet's and Ophelia's hands moving like a bird's wings, shown when the pair 
  converse in the beginning as well as at her funeral, are a brilliant stroke. 
  <br>
  At least two of the scenes are actually better with no words. The play-within-a-play, 
  when Hamlet gets the actors to represent his father's death and betrayal by 
  his mother, comes off as a vicious satire of the earlier death scene, with mourners 
  crying their crocodile tears as they secretly rejoice at the change on the throne. 
  The closing scene, accompanied by crashing, throbbing music and acrobatic swordplay, 
  could scarcely be more satisfying. When Hamlet finally gets his revenge, you 
  see justice enacted before your eyes. <br>
  Synetic Theater has tremendous promise if its future plays are anything like 
  this one. A &quot;Hamlet&quot; without words might seem like a meal without 
  food, but if you're skeptical, see it yourself.<br>
