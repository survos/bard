<p>A strong 'Othello' with room to grow<br>
  By Eric M. Johnson<br>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  When the play opens, Othello (Craig Wallace) has married the beautiful Desdemona 
  (Suli Holum) without her father Brabantio's consent. Despairing, her father 
  (Lawrence Redmond) charges Othello with witchcraft and brings him before the 
  Duke of Venice to answer for it. As a trusted general of the city's army, he 
  is acquitted when Desdemona proclaims that she freely consented to the marriage.<br>
  Iago (Trey Lyford), Othello's ensign, has lost a promotion to the inexperienced 
  Cassio (Dwayne Nitz), who now serves as Othello's second in command. He allies 
  himself with Roderigo (Scot McKenzie), a man enraged by his unsuccessful courtship 
  of Desdemona. Together they work so Iago can destroy Othello and Roderigo can 
  have his bride.<br>
  This is a production in which race plays a surprisingly small part, given the 
  material &#8212; although Othello is Christian and a loyal Venetian, he is a 
  dark-skinned Moor. Director Aaron Posner opts for the far more difficult strategy 
  of building dramatic tension through plot and pacing, instead of reaching for 
  an emotional hot button.<br>
  There are several references to the protagonist's skin color, comparing his 
  blackness to sin, for instance. Given that, there is no indication from the 
  text that Iago hates Othello for racial reasons; to the contrary, Shakespeare 
  explains his malice by Iago's ambition and icy hatred of his superior.<br>
  Mr. Lyford reveals Iago's evil with facial expressions that make him look less 
  than human. When given the choice between a light, potentially funny line reading 
  and a more serious one, he chooses the former. He is able to feign sincerity 
  with the best of them &#8212; telling Cassio that reputation doesn't matter 
  at all, then telling Othello that &quot;he that filches from me my good name 
  makes me poor indeed.&quot; <br>
  In his hands, Mr. Lyford's Iago is almost droll, even attractive, which almost 
  makes up for the lack of dramatic heft.<br>
  The estimable Holly Twyford plays Iago's wife, Emilia, as a woman heartsick 
  because her husband no longer shows her any love. Desperate to rekindle his 
  affections, she steals a handkerchief from Desdemona that was a precious gift 
  from Othello and gives it to Iago. Iago then plants the handkerchief in Cassio's 
  chamber. Othello has his cause to order Cassio's death and to take his revenge 
  on Desdemona.<br>
  Emilia is one of the more subtle characters in the play, and Miss Twyford captures 
  her weakness and divided loyalties nicely. Her queasy reluctance to tell the 
  truth about the handkerchief, and risk her husband's wrath, is one of the chief 
  pleasures of the production.<br>
  Mr. Nitz excels at playing the wronged, virtuous Cassio, whose relationship 
  with Desdemona is wholly chaste. Miss Holum, as Desdemona, has an appropriately 
  virginal look to her (not to mention a mellifluous singing voice). Her perfect 
  innocence works well as she is sacrificed to the gods of men's passions. For 
  some reason, she is put into an unnecessary, imaginary sex scene, as Othello 
  is picturing Cassio coupling with her. Some things are best left to the imagination.<br>
  Mr. Wallace is a formidable actor, and well worthy to take on Othello. His baritone 
  resonates and shifts between a bare whisper and a leonine roar; his stage presence 
  is commanding. He is one of those rare actors who can command a scene when standing 
  still.<br>
  Yet his performance is missing two crucial aspects. As a professional soldier, 
  his weakness is that he believes others will be as honest and dutiful as he, 
  but his own childlike honesty and trust doesn't emerge. (This is hardly helped 
  by his costume for most of the show, which never resembles a general's uniform 
  even when he is returning from battle.)<br>
  Second, although Othello is a man of rectitude and high standing, his unapproved 
  marriage to Desdemona was a severe breach of social grace and (at least implicitly) 
  a slap in the face to her father. Othello must have known Brabantio would have 
  reacted badly, but he looks surprised when that happens. His character must 
  have had at least a streak of hotheadedness for him to act that way, but again, 
  we never see it.<br>
  This &quot;Othello&quot; has no low points, and no major flaws. If the actors 
  turn up the energy a few notches and continue to flesh out their characters, 
  they may well perfect an already first-rate show by the end of the run.<br>
