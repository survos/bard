<p>So much to love in Folger's 'As You Like It'<br>

  &quot;As You Like It,&quot; under the able direction of Aaron Posner, ends the 
  Folger Theatre&acute;s season on a high note. The venerable theater has given 
  Washington a nearly flawless rendition of a beloved play by William Shakespeare.<br>
  In describing a Shakespearean comedy, one could begin with a series of standard 
  questions: Is there cross-dressing? Yes. What is the bad thing that happens 
  at the beginning? Banishment. How many couples are married at the end? Four.<br>
  The Bard relied on standard formulas to construct his plots and did not see 
  the need to invent new stories for his plays, but his comedies are more real 
  than &quot;realistic&quot; modern dramas. &quot;As You Like It&quot; is his 
  funniest and best comedy and offers a superabundance of material to actors and 
  director alike. The dialogue is quick and witty, and the plot is intricate yet 
  transparent. Even the smallest parts are invested with vitality.<br>
  The play opens with an allusion to the Prodigal Son, as the firstborn, Oliver 
  (Craig Wallace), argues with the last-born, Orlando (Jerry Richardson), about 
  the latter&acute;s ill treatment after their father&acute;s death. Later, at 
  the Duke&acute;s palace, Frederick (Marty Lodge) -- who banished the real duke, 
  his older brother, and stole his brother&acute;s title -- is playing host to 
  a wrestling contest.<br>
  Orlando wins the contest and meets his true love, Rosalind (Holly Twyford), 
  in the process. Although she gives him no cause, the usurper Frederick banishes 
  Rosalind from his lands. Rosalind&acute;s cousin and best friend, Celia, agrees 
  to come with her to Arden Forest. To protect themselves against marauders, Rosalind 
  disguises herself as a man, with Celia as her attendant. The smitten Orlando, 
  with his old servant Adam (Kate Eastwood Norris), continues to pursue her.<br>
  As the action continues, we meet the real Duke (Mr. Lodge), another brother 
  of Oliver and Orlando&acute;s named Jaques (Mr. Wallace) and the comical couple 
  of Phebe (Miss Norris) and Silvius (Mr. Wallace yet again). Silvius loves Phebe, 
  but she does not love him; however, when Phebe sees Rosalind, alias &quot;Ganymede,&quot; 
  she falls in love immediately.<br>
  Alfred North Whitehead said that Western philosophy is &quot;a series of footnotes 
  to Plato.&quot; Maybe, but you also could say that commentary on relations between 
  the sexes is just a series of amplifications of Shakespeare. The rest of the 
  play is taken up with Rosalind endeavoring to determine whether Orlando&acute;s 
  devotion is genuine by having &quot;Ganymede&quot; try to convince him that 
  he is really not in love. &quot;Maides are May when they are maids, but the 
  sky changes when they are wives,&quot; she tells him. Practically anything you 
  want to know about the opposite sex is laid out here.<br>
  As in so many of Shakespeare&acute;s plays, the female lead is much more compelling 
  than the male. As Rosalind, Miss Twyford is nothing short of superb. She is 
  simultaneously feminine and masculine, boyish without overplaying it.<br>
  To see her play a woman impersonating a man playing a woman, as she does in 
  the scenes with Orlando, is the highlight in a production filled with highlights. 
  Mr. Richardson is capable and affable as Orlando, but his lover drives the action. 
  There is scarcely enough room here to catalog the other sterling performances, 
  though they all deserve mention.<br>
  Andrew Ross Wynn plays four characters, male and female, and provides a disproportionate 
  share of the laughs. Miss Norris, playing another four characters, gives Mr. 
  Wynn a run in the humor competition. As the clown Touchstone, Christopher Crutchfield 
  Walker contributes a cynical wit and deft timing.<br>
  The sole shortcoming of the production is that it doesn&acute;t do much with 
  the contrast between the intrigue of the court and the supposed innocence of 
  the forest. Phebe is supposed to be a shepherdess, something you would know 
  only from paying close attention to the dialogue, because she dresses like a 
  nerdy schoolgirl. Some of the satire is thereby lost, though there is plenty 
  to spare, particularly in the way the Bard calls attention to the ridiculous 
  ways lovers are apt to speak to one another.<br>
  There are two major ways to mount a production of a Shakespeare text. One is 
  to regard the work as an empty vessel into which any idea might be poured; thus 
  we get feminist versions of &quot;Taming of the Shrew,&quot; and &quot;Richard 
  III&quot; set during the Third Reich. The other is to begin with wonder at how 
  marvelously humane and insightful it is and to draw from those riches and interpret 
  them for the audience.<br>
  Mr. Posner and his cast have followed the second path, to their credit and our 
  benefit. If you have the slightest affection for Shakespeare, you will find 
  this &quot;As You Like It&quot; likable indeed. * * * *<br>
