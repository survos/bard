  A straggler among Shakespeare's works, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; is rarely 
  seen on the stage. Washingtonians now can understand why. The Shakespeare Theatre 
  tries to squeeze some grandeur and pathos out of the text but can't find enough 
  to make a decent show.<br>
  Timon (Philip Goodwin), inheritor of a large fortune, has a constant swirl of 
  sycophants and hangers-on clinging to his garments. He wastes his wealth on 
  fancy gifts and dinners with his friends and cares not in the least about his 
  properties and finances.<br>
  When his lands are all mortgaged and his money runs out, he turns to his loyal 
  old steward Flavius (Emery Battis) and then begs his friends to help him in 
  his penury. This being a tragedy, his friends laugh off the request, thinking 
  it a joke.<br>
  Without a drachma to his name, Timon goes insane and goes off to live in a junkyard 
  (in Shakespeare's text, a cave). Meanwhile, Alcibiades (Michael Genet), an Athenian 
  military hero, is exiled for defending one of his men against a murder charge. 
  The soldier vows revenge against the venal, money-grubbing senators who sentence 
  him. He and Timon meet in the wasteland outside the city, with the former impotently 
  railing against the corruption of Athens and the latter preparing to take the 
  city by force.<br>
  As Timon, Mr. Goodwin has very little with which to work. He has some vituperative 
  speeches, but no enemies vex him as in the major Shakespearean tragedies. The 
  closest he has is Apemantus (Ted van Griethuysen), an itinerant philosopher 
  who warns him against trusting the men whom he called &quot;friends.&quot; Apemantus 
  later finds Timon to discuss his fate, and their verbal exchange manages to 
  rise above the rest of the dialogue.<br>
  Mr. Genet is an experienced actor who has appeared on Broadway and in movies, 
  but he keeps moving his body in jarring ways as if he wants to escape the strictures 
  of his role. He shows Alcibiades as a more noble figure than Timon, because 
  he is banished for trying to save one of his own men, but the part calls for 
  more posturing than heroism.<br>
  The difficulty here is that &quot;Timon&quot; is a shorter, less developed &quot;King 
  Lear,&quot; and the comparisons between the two make &quot;Timon&quot; look 
  even worse. The play has some good epigrams: &quot;Nothing so emboldens sin 
  as mercy,&quot; and &quot;He that loves to be flattered is worthy o' the flatterer.&quot; 
  But the verses are oceans away from the incandescent poetry of &quot;Lear,&quot; 
  though the plays were written only three or four years apart.<br>
  More important, &quot;Timon&quot; provides little to engage the audience's emotions. 
  The scholar E.K. Chambers surmised that &quot;Timon&quot; was a first draft 
  that Shakespeare never bothered to rewrite, a theory that snugly fits the facts.<br>
  &quot;Lear&quot; has the honest, loving Cordelia, but &quot;Timon&quot; has 
  no one to sympathize with -- and no one to root against, either. Timon's friends 
  are petty, but not cruel. They even might have lent him money if they had thought 
  his plight was serious. &quot;Lear&quot; is about a sinful man who receives 
  more than his due for his failures, seeing his earthly loves and possessions 
  slip away while he drifts toward the precipice of death. &quot;Timon&quot; is 
  the chronicle of a silly man who dies hating humanity for no good reason.<br>
  Director Michael Kahn moves the play forward in time from fifth-century Athens 
  to 1980s America, but that doesn't help. &quot;Modernizing&quot; Shakespeare 
  is a common enough device, but why the '80s? Other than aerobics and electronic 
  music, the decade doesn't have much to contribute aesthetically. Mr. Kahn apparently 
  wanted to root &quot;Timon&quot; in the &quot;decade of greed,&quot; but the 
  '90s -- the decade that gave us day trading, the SUV and the super-size meal 
  -- would be a good comparison, too. The audience also would not have to endure 
  break dancing.<br>
  A large wall of metal and glass, running at a skewed angle from the lights to 
  the stage floor, symbolizes Timon's flashy surroundings, then his descent into 
  hopelessness when it appears with broken panes in Act IV. The majority of Walt 
  Spangler's sets are organized around this sleek backdrop, although it has the 
  effect of foreshortening the depth of the stage and making the action appear 
  as two-dimensional as the script. Elizabeth Hope Clancy's period costumes are 
  depressingly accurate, right down to the Converse high tops.<br>
  That even Shakespeare was capable of writing a bad play may comfort some. But 
  if you find it curious that the words &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and &quot;bad 
  play&quot; can appear in the same sentence, you may want to see &quot;Timon 
  of Athens.&quot; That is the strongest reason to see it, whether staged by the 
  Shakespeare Theatre or anyone else.<br>
