        HTML table generated from a php call to fetch the doctrine entities.  Rendered in twig.  Exactly what make:crud produces.
        Advantages: Simple
        Disadvantages: no search, no sorting.

work_html_plus_datatable:
  notes: |
    HTML table generated in Twig, datatables applied to the twig table.
    Advantages: Searching, sorting.
    Disadvantages: large HTML page.

work_doctrine_api_platform:
  title: API Platform (Doctrine)
  notes: |
    Empty HTML page, javascript calls datatable with API Platform standard get call for the collection.
    Advantages: For a small result swork_doctrine_datatable

  The AdminLTE-3 CSS and JS (Bootstrap 4 plus custom styles) for this site comes from the *yarn* library.

  The AdminLTEBundle is used for Twig Macros, Controllers, and Events

  SurvosBaseBundle is used for rendering the menu and providing default pages.

bard.intro: |
    This site is a repository of Shakespeare's works.  The data comes from Open Source Shakepeare.

    So why another site?  First, I wanted to get Shakepeare in the Fountain screenplay format, so it could be used with other tools.
    For example, the characters are listed as a regular HTML table, the same HTML table with the DataTable library applied, and
    finally using dynamic loading with API Platform.  Someday we'll add full-text search via ElasticSearch.

site.intro: |
    The *real* reason for this site is a playground for testing tools, with a database that wasn't complicated to understand, but wasn't so simple as to be trivial.
    The tools that are tested here:

        * Symfony 5.1: The latest version of the best PHP framework.
        * AdminLTEBundle: A terrific bundle for integrating bootstrap and styling the pages and menus.
        * DataTables: A slick library for easily displaying tabular data.
        * API Platform:

pages:
    character_datatable_via_api: |
        The table element is empty in the page, and the data is loaded via API-Platform.
        Alas, the pagination at the moment requires two api calls.
    character_index: Basic table, generated by make:crud, with just Boostrap table styling.
    character_datatable: |
        All the characters are loaded into an HTML table, so this page is large, but very fast, with no additional API calls.
        The table can be configured with data- attributes for the DataTable() call.
