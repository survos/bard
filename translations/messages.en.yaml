    character_datatable_via_api: |
        The table element is empty in the page, and the data is loaded via API-Platform.
        Alas, the pagination at the moment requires two api calls.
    character_index: Basic table, generated by make:crud, with just Boostrap table styling.
    character_datatable: |
        All the characters are loaded into an HTML table, so this page is large, but very fast, with no additional API calls.
        The table can be configured with data- attributes for the DataTable() call.
