bard.intro: |
    This site is a repository of Shakespeare's works.  The data comes from Open Source Shakepeare.

    So why another site?  First, I wanted to get Shakepeare in the Fountain screenplay format, so it could be used with other tools.
    For example, the characters are listed as a regular HTML table, the same HTML table with the DataTable library applied, and
    finally using dynamic loading with API Platform.  Someday we'll add full-text search via ElasticSearch.

site.intro: |
    The *real* reason for this site is a playground for testing tools, with a database that wasn't complicated to understand, but wasn't so simple as to be trivial.
    The tools that are tested here:

        * Symfony 5.1: The latest version of the best PHP framework.
        * AdminLTEBundle: A terrific bundle for integrating bootstrap and styling the pages and menus.
        * DataTables: A slick library for easily displaying tabular data.
        * API Platform:

pages:
    character_datatable_via_api: |
        The table element is empty in the page, and the data is loaded via API-Platform.
        Alas, the pagination at the moment requires two api calls.
    character_index: Basic table, generated by make:crud, with just Boostrap table styling.
    character_datatable: |
        All the characters are loaded into an HTML table, so this page is large, but very fast, with no additional API calls.
        The table can be configured with data- attributes for the DataTable() call.
